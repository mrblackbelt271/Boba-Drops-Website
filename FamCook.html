        <h1>An (Alleged) Family Cookout</h1>
        <p></p>
        <p class="desc">I unfortunately do not have a picture for this story; I hope that my descriptions are enough to paint a suitable picture.</p>
        <p></p>
        <div class="desc">
            <p class="first">As I was picking up trash around the cookout areas, I saw many <i>curious</i> things.</p>
            <p>Among them was proof of a family cookout, or so I presume. There was a burnt foil wrapping tossed to the side, fluttering in the wind; clearly, it had been used to cook something.</p>
            <p>Another article of trash I saw was a hi-chew, a candy <strong>highly</strong> popular with children; I also found multiple (too many to count) Coronoa bottle caps - it seems that Corona is a popular choice for all park-goers that drink.</p>
            <p>The final items that sealed the deal were some scattered paper plates and a sticker from a grill, explaining all its features and advantages. It was conceivable that the group that held the cookout had bought a new grill, and after their eating and drinking was done, they left their plates and sticker from the brand new grill for the park to... <i>remember them</i>.</p>
            <p>In the end, it is impossible to know exactly what happened since I was not there; however, it was rather amusing to look at the evidence left behind and formulate a plausible story for the trash.</p>
