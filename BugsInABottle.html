            <p class="first">This is by far one of the most thought-provoking items I found, however gross <s>(or sad, depending on how you look at it)</s> it is.</p>
            <p>When I first saw it, I saw black stuff drowned in an orange liquid. Upon further inspection, I saw that it was a <u>bottle of Smirnoff Screwdriver</u>, a concoction of vodka and orange juice - filled with a myriad of insects, of course (distastefully so).</p>
            <p>Among them were wasps, bees, and multiple species (or maybe not, they were just different sizes) of ants, many of which are covered by the sticker on the bottle - not to mention that upon picking up the bottle, I accidentally poured out some of the drink along with multiple insects.</p>
            <p>But after overcoming my initial distaste to the grisly sight, I began to think of how this happened - someone decided that they did not like their drink and tossed it to the side, 80% full (for context, this was next to a cookout area, so it was likely a barebecue of some sort).</p>
            <p>Since the juice had not dried out or become contaminated with rainwater, it was clear that this was a relatively new addition to the landscape - and to have amassed so many insects!</p>
            <p>It made me think of how this could be a <strong>metaphor</strong> for many situations or circumstances in our lives; something so enticing, be it a new opportunity, relationship, or interesting game/show, can quickly lead to ruin - the new opportunity may be a job that pays a lot but makes one want to pull their hair out; the new relationship could be a friendship that results in betrayal or exclusion; the new game/show might distract someone into being unproductive; whatever the case may be, certain things can become a Smirnoff Screwdriver - they can lure us in with their orangey sweetness, then kill us with their alcohol content, or simply drown us.</p>
            <p>Unluckily for insects, they cannot tell when the new food source they found will kill them; luckily for us, we <s>(usually)</s> know not to eat from some hands that feed, for they might bite us. </p>
