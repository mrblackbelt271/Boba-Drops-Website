            <p class="first">One <i>very</i> common find that stuck out to me the most was the rather ubiquitous distribution of leftover alcoholic beverages.</p>
            <p>Above are 2 images of some wholly intact bottles I found. The most common finds were just the caps of these bottles, as well as beer cans. The most popular choices, based on the trash I found, seemed to be Corona and Bud Light. </p>
            <p>Most of these were found near awnings and pavillions, where parties may have been held (I once even saw confetti under one pavillion). However, I also found them in rather random places; <i>how</i> did a whiskey bottle end up 3 trees deep into a forest? It must have been thrown there, but how and why?</p>
            <p>My theory is, given that alcohol is known to be a depressant (<strong>not</strong> the one that makes you sad, the one that reduces stimulation - one can read more about how alcohol is a depressant here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)" class="specialLink">About Alcohol</a>), that those who drank were probably too relaxed to throw away their trash (<s>properly</s>) but had enough energy to scuttle their act by throwing it far enough into the forest that no one will find it, or simply leaving it where they last were.</p>
            <p>Whatever the case may be, it is an undeniable fact that many alcoholic beverage bottles are left at the park - one can only speculate how they got there based on their surrounding context!</p>
